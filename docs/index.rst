Welcome to sscRaft documentation!
=====================================

Sirius Scientific Computing approach for Image reconstruction from projections!
RAFT is an acronym to ``Reconstruction algorithms for tomography``, which is the
main package, implemented in low/high level languages, with the purpose
of image reconstruction for tomographic Sirius beamlines.  This package was initially
implemented for the so-called IMX beamline from old storage ring UVX/LNLS.
It is now being readapted for future tomographic beamlines using new
coding strategies and recent mathematical developments regarding image reconstruction,
which is the case needed for LNLS/Sirius imaging beamlines as Carnaúba, Cateretê, Mogno, Quati,
among others.

Codes and public prototypes are being increasingly included within this project,
as long as they are tested and developed by the Scientific Computing Group.
