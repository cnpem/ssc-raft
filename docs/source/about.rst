Sirius Scientific Computing approach for image reconstruction.
RAFT is an acronym to Reconstruction Algorithms For Tomography, and is being developed for more than 10 years,
as an effort to support imaging beamlines from Sirius - the 4th generation Brazilian synchrotron.
Implemented in low/high level languages, has the purpose of fast and robust image reconstruction for large data-sets.
This package was initially implemented for the IMX beamline from old storage ring UVX/LNLS.
It is now being readapted for future tomographic beamlines using new
coding strategies and recent mathematical developments regarding image reconstruction,
which is the case needed for LNLS/Sirius imaging beamlines such as as Carnaúba, Cateretê, Mogno, Quati,
among others.

Codes and public prototypes are being increasingly included within this project,
as long as they are tested and developed by the Scientific Computing Group.  

The ``ssc-raft`` package source code is available in `zenodo website <https://zenodo.org/>`_ under the 
DOI: `10.5281/zenodo.10988342 <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10988342>`_.
